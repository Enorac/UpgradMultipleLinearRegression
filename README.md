# Project Name
Create a multiple linear regression model in python on a bike rental business


## Table of Contents
* Used the jupyter python notebook
* Temperature, season, wind, and year are the most significant variables

## General Information
- The dataset is a two years of data from a bike rental business. They have the months, counts of sales, seasons, weather, years, temperature

## Conclusions
- The most important variable is the weather, if a bike rental business wants to succeed they should choose a city with good weather year round. This is also a fast growing technology so we can expect growth no matter what.
- Weekdays were uncorrelated, and workingdays were uncorrelated
- ended up with 9 variables after splitting up months, weather, and seasons into dummy columns. Then removing high P values, and then removing VIF values above 5

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8-3975531
- sklearn
- statsmodels
- pandas
- seaborn
- numpy
